Known Bugs & Issues:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1 On Windows 7/8 the theme engine highlights menu items in white colour, and
   text ( being white as well ) becomes invisible(well they basically blend in).
   For the time being, the default(Raleigh) theme is used to avoid this bug.

#2 When scrolling over the text in Scrolled Window (in the testwindow), the text
   becomes distorted(Possible Fix: Redraw everytime window is scrolled.)

   Solution: The problem was caused by using "<span size='x'>" property in 
   the gtk.Label which was added to the scrolled window , i reckon this is an 
   implementation problem or some sort of a conflict problem 
   between gtk and pango library. It was fixed by replacing "<span size='x'>"
   with "<span font='x'>". One thing to note is that the glade file was 
   modified, since attributes for "<span size='x'>" were set there. The 
   attributes were removed from all labels in test and result window, and 
   subsequent markups were added in the main module sorce

#3 When the result window is exited from the 'X' Button at the top of the 
   window and another test is taken, The result window is blank and exiting
   it does not show the main window again and the program keeps running but
   no window appears.

   Solution: The problem was a missing "return True" statement in the callback
   that acted as the signal handler for that button. Since that button emitted 
   an event and all event handlers need return to a bool signifying whether the 
   event was handled or not, the missing statment caused the callback to return
   a 'None' datatype to the event handling mechanism, which evaluates to 
   'False'. What basically happens after that was, that GTk event handling 
   mechanism would proceed to destroy the window and when the next time the 
   result window was shown, all it's content would not be there since they had
   been destroyed.
